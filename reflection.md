- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
My inital impressions of Java are that firstly, it is very different from Python, which I find really challenging but it's also kind of helpful to know what things can somewhat look like coming from Python and really adapting those ideas. Additionally, I think that Java is a bit more disorganized in the sense of using {} instead of just tabs, it makes things look a little more jumbled and for me, it makes it harder to follow code. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I would say that coniditonals and for loops are pretty consistent, although different. However, the overall structure of the code as I mentioend above with {} is a huge change as well as the commands used to print and do basic things that could've been done a lot more easily in Python. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Talking to peers, TAs, and attending office hours definitely helped! In additon, using the internet to find ways to implement different parts of the code also really helped. To someone taking this course in the future, I would say to read instructions thoroughly so you are not missig anything and make sure to test your code as often as possible.
